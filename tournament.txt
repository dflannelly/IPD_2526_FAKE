Player 0 (P0): Better TFT, Better Tit for Tat
        It is Tit for Tat so it picks the move the opponent did last. It also gi
        ves out 2 c after a bad pattern repeats. It also changes c,b,c,b loops t
        o b,b,b,b loops
Player 1 (P1): GACA_FHA, GACA
        Returns c, if the opponent's history indicates that they have returned b
         for a while the GACA will also return b.
Player 2 (P2): deez, 99.99% betrayal
        will betray you 99.99% of the time
Player 3 (P3): Digital Destroyers, Nice-but-not-nice
        The first output is always to collude. As it analyses its history, it tr
        ies to be nice after betraying five times at most. But the strategy of t
        he program is to be nice but not gullible, so it also betrays back after
         the opponent betrays twice continuously. Just so that the program doesn
        t get into a loop, there is also a random choice in which it will pick b
        etray 3 out of 5 times.
Player 4 (P4): GameTheory, Randomness unless you backstab
        If the opponent colludes than the algorithm randomly selects c or b for 
        the next round. If the opponent backstabs, than the algorithm will alway
        s backstab back. 
Player 5 (P5): Flan, Randomness unless you backstab
        If the opponent colludes than the algorithm randomly selects c or b for 
        the next round. If the opponent backstabs, than the algorithm will alway
        s backstab back. 
Player 6 (P6): hallo_Mami, bye bye mami backstab if opponent cooperating, be random otherwise
        Will take advantage of cooperative programs. Will also use the power of 
        randomness with evens and odds determining cooperation or backstabbing
Player 7 (P7): I hope I win, my_strategy
        How does this strategy decide?
Player 8 (P8): Judgement, Ratio-based choice
        If the opponent has mostly cooperated, cooperate back. Otherwise, backst
        ab.
Player 9 (P9): Perilous Plum, Randomness leaning towards betrays
        The first output starts with a betray and attacks from the start. From t
        here, many of the rounds (including every 20 rounds) pull from a random 
        list that favors betraying over colluding, making it unpredictable and p
        atternless.
Player 10 (P10): Sadness, The Winning Strategy
        On the first round, it betrays. If its losing, it betrays, and if its wi
        nning it has a 66.67% chance to collude. If the opponent has betrayed in
         the last 2 rounds or colludes twice in a row, it betrays. Other than th
        at, it colludes.
Player 11 (P11): TheThinkR, BrainPower!!!
        It Uses its Brain Power
Player 12 (P12): Wyche Winners, Betrayal
        This strategy will win every round because I am mostly betraying instead
         of cooperating.
Player 13 (P13): Mvaiio, Protocol
        Enemy History
